    "- After training, evaluate the model using the test dataset.\n",
    "- Calculate accuracy and other relevant metrics to measure model performance.\n",

    "## 6. Fine-tuning and Optimization\n",
    "- Optionally implement techniques like learning rate scheduling, early stopping, and model checkpointing to improve training efficiency and model performance.\n"
